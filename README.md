- Baseline control sets (Low, Moderate, High impact levels)

### 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0
- Complete CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Categories and subcategories with detailed descriptions
- Framework core structure and relationships

### 🔗 Control Mappings
- SP 800-53 to CSF mappings
- Cross-reference controls with framework subcategories
- Bidirectional relationship analysis

### 📋 OSCAL Support
- JSON schema validation for OSCAL documents
- Support for catalogs, profiles, SSPs, assessment plans, and POA&Ms
- Example OSCAL documents for reference

### 🔍 Advanced Search & Analysis
- Keyword search across control content

- Baseline compliance checking

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable Python package management. uv is significantly faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution.

### 1. Installation

#### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nist-mcp.git
cd nist-mcp

# Run the installation script (installs uv, dependencies, and downloads data)
./scripts/install.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nist-mcp.git
cd nist-mcp

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync --dev

# Or with pip (alternative)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Download NIST Data

```bash
# Download official NIST data sources
python scripts/download_nist_data.py

# For verbose output
python scripts/download_nist_data.py --verbose

# Force re-download existing files
python scripts/download_nist_data.py --force
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
# Start the MCP server
nist-mcp

# Or run directly with Python
python -m nist_mcp.server
```

## MCP Tools Available

The server provides the following MCP tools for AI assistants:

### Control Management
- `list_controls()` - List all available NIST controls
- `get_control(control_id)` - Get detailed control information
- `search_controls(query, family, limit)` - Search controls by keyword
- `get_control_family(family)` - Get all controls in a family (e.g., "AC", "AU")
- `get_control_mappings(control_id)` - Get CSF mappings for a control
- `get_control_baselines(baseline)` - Get controls for Low/Moderate/High baselines

### Framework Access
- Access to complete NIST CSF 2.0 structure
- Function, category, and subcategory details
- Framework relationships and mappings

### OSCAL Processing
- Schema validation for OSCAL documents
- Example document templates
- Support for all major OSCAL document types

## Data Sources

This project uses official public domain data from NIST:

### Primary Sources
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** - Security and Privacy Controls (Public Domain)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0** - Framework Core (Public Domain)
- **OSCAL Schemas v1.1.3** - Open Security Controls Assessment Language (Apache 2.0)

### Downloaded Content
- Complete SP 800-53 controls catalog (JSON/XML)
- Low, Moderate, and High baseline profiles
- CSF 2.0 functions, categories, and subcategories
- Control-to-CSF mappings
- OSCAL JSON schemas for all document types

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Setup development environment (includes pre-commit hooks)
make setup-dev

# Or manually:
pre-commit install
```

### Testing

We use a comprehensive testing approach with multiple layers:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-security      # Security and vulnerability tests
make test-quality       # Code quality and linting
make test-integration   # MCP integration tests
make test-performance   # Performance and load tests
make test-coverage      # Coverage analysis

# Code quality tools
make lint              # Ruff linting
make format            # Code formatting
make type-check        # MyPy type checking
make security          # Bandit + Safety security scans
```

### Code Quality Tools

- **uv**: Fast Python package manager (10-100x faster than pip)
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanner
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability checker
- **MyPy**: Static type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework with async support
- **Coverage**: Code coverage analysis

### Why uv?

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management because it:
- **10-100x faster** than pip for dependency resolution and installation
- **Better dependency resolution** with conflict detection
- **Reproducible builds** with lock files
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Drop-in replacement** for pip with better UX

### Adding New Tools

The MCP server is designed for extensibility. To add new tools:

1. Create tool functions in `src/nist_mcp/server.py`
2. Use the `@app.tool()` decorator
3. Add data loading logic to `data/loader.py` if needed
4. Update tests and documentation

## Configuration

### Data Path
By default, the server looks for data in the `data/` directory. You can specify a custom path:

```python
from nist_mcp.server import NISTMCPServer
server = NISTMCPServer(data_path="/custom/path/to/data")
```

### Logging
Configure logging level for debugging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
